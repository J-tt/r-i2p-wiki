# FAQ:

* I found a bug!

Check [this thread](https://pay.reddit.com/r/i2p/comments/1bnhb3/official_report_bugs_here_thread/) on how to report it.

* Can I use I2P as a proxy to the internet?

It's not recommended as that is not the main use of I2P, but you can. See information on [outproxies](http://www.i2p2.de/faq.html#exit) for more.
